# Barakatna Platform Database Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Barakatna Platform database, based on the SQL schema provided. The database will support the senior care home modification system with multi-tenant design for different client types (FDF, ADHA, Cash).

## Database Structure

The database is organized into four main domains:

1. **Core Client Domain** - Manages client types, users, roles, senior citizens, and properties
2. **Assessment Domain** - Handles assessments, room assessments, measurements, and recommendations
3. **Project Management Domain** - Manages cohorts, projects, and tasks
4. **Client-Specific Domains** - Contains FDF and ADHA specific tables

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Database Setup

1. **Create Database Schema**
   - Implement the SQL schema in the target database system
   - Set up proper indexing for performance optimization
   - Ensure all constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) are properly defined

2. **Data Migration Strategy**
   - Develop scripts to migrate data from existing Excel files
   - Create validation rules to ensure data integrity during migration
   - Implement data cleansing procedures for inconsistent data

### Phase 2: Data Access Layer

1. **ORM Implementation**
   - Use TypeORM or Prisma for database access
   - Define entity models that map to database tables
   - Implement repository pattern for data access

2. **API Development**
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for each entity
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Add validation for all API inputs

### Phase 3: Integration with Frontend

1. **Component Integration**
   - Connect WorkflowNavigator component with Status table
   - Link RoomAssessmentForm with RoomAssessment, Measurement, and Recommendation tables
   - Connect BeneficiaryProfile with SeniorCitizen table

2. **Data Mapping**
   - Implement bidirectional mapping between frontend models and database entities
   - Handle multilingual content (Arabic/English) properly
   - Ensure proper date/time handling across systems

## Database Relationships

### Key Relationships

1. **Client Hierarchy**
   - ClientType -> SeniorCitizen -> Property
   - ClientType -> Assessment
   - ClientType -> Project
   - ClientType -> Cohort

2. **Assessment Flow**
   - Assessment -> RoomAssessment -> Measurement
   - Assessment -> RoomAssessment -> Recommendation
   - Assessment -> MentalHealthAssessment (FDF)
   - Assessment -> AccessibilityRequirement (ADHA)

3. **Project Management**
   - Project -> Task
   - Cohort -> Project

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**
   - Implement row-level security for multi-tenant isolation
   - Encrypt sensitive personal information
   - Implement audit logging for all data changes

2. **Access Control**
   - Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via User and Role tables
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
   - Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Performance Optimization

1. **Indexing Strategy**
   - Create indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Use covering indexes for common query patterns
   - Implement proper statistics maintenance

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Optimize complex joins with proper indexing
   - Use pagination for large result sets
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Database Monitoring**
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Implement alerting for critical issues
   - Regular backup and recovery testing

2. **Schema Evolution**
   - Develop migration scripts for schema changes
   - Implement versioning for database schema
   - Document all schema changes

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1-2**: Database schema creation and initial setup
2. **Week 3-4**: Data migration from existing systems
3. **Week 5-6**: ORM implementation and API development
4. **Week 7-8**: Frontend integration and testing
5. **Week 9**: Performance optimization and security hardening
6. **Week 10**: Final testing and deployment

## Next Steps

1. Finalize database technology selection
2. Set up development database environment
3. Begin schema implementation
4. Create initial data migration scripts
5. Develop TypeScript interfaces for database entities
