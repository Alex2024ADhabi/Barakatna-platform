## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Mobile Components**: The mobile module has 0% implementation and contains several high-priority components that should be addressed immediately.

2. **Focus on Core Functionality**: Components related to assessment, beneficiary management, and project management should be prioritized as they form the core of the platform.

3. **Standardize UI Components**: Implement storyboards for common UI components to ensure consistency across the platform.

4. **Implement Authentication Flow**: Complete the authentication components to ensure a seamless user experience.

5. **Phased Implementation Approach**: 
   - Phase 1: Complete all high-priority components (18 items)
   - Phase 2: Address medium-priority components in core modules
   - Phase 3: Complete remaining components

## Next Steps

1. Create a detailed implementation plan with timelines for each phase
2. Assign resources to high-priority components
3. Establish a review process for completed storyboards
4. Set up regular progress tracking meetings
5. Update this document as storyboards are implemented
